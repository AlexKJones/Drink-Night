What it does:
This is the Drink Night App API so this handles the server side that communicates to the front end how to handle requests for data to and from the database such as how to create users or events or how to edit view or delete them. Specifically this api gives rules for signing up, in, out and editing the password for users and then creates, destroys, indexes, finds, and updates events for the user.
